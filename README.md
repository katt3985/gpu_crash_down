# GPU Crash Down
GPU crash down is meant to be a project to help make Linux GPU crashes better comapired to how they are now by implimenting the following:

1. Building a central platform for common solutions, hotfixes, and data collection for GPU crashes
2. Automating data collection to drive better troubleshooting tools
3. simplifying the troubleshooting process by catching common causes and producing recommended steps to users and well as making the process of filing bug reports less painful to end users
4. provinding feedback to users about their issues in clearer and more user friendly terms.

to do this, the project will have a few phases that in the end will serve as a different approaches to the problem of troubleshooting GPU issues

## Phase Alpha

Phase Alpha will consist of the following tools when complete:
1. a website that contains crash reports and feedback on how those issues were solved
2. a moble app that can be used to gather data and troubleshoot GPU issues
3. on system software that can detect when the GPU has crashed and gather data for a crash report

## Phase Final

Phase Final, a sort of 1.0 senario will have the following:

1. A database of automatically collected GPU crash reports for investigating bugs using data analysis techniques
2. an on system, userspace application for tuning GPU drivers regardless of make
3. an on system, kernelspace application for data collection and crash recovery
4. a moble app to guide users through the process of troubleshooting.
